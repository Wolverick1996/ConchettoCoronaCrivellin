\subsection{Purpose}
\hspace{-\parindent}This document is intended to give a broad description of the three services offered by TrackMe: Data4Help, AutomatedSOS and Track4Run. This will be done by a detailed presentation of the proposed solution and its purpose, listing its objectives, and the requirements and assumptions through which they will be achieved. The document is meant to be used by the clients, users and also by the parties designated with the task of creating the specified system, mainly the system and requirements analysts, the project managers, software developers and testers.\newline
\\
The company TrackMe wants to offer third parties the ability to monitor the position and health status of groups of people. To do this they decided to create an app, called TrackMe, which can offer this type of service and at the same time also allows ordinary users to register and make their data available in exchange for continuous monitoring. Data4Help is a service that manages the data collected by users, who can decide whether to be available to be completely traceable or to participate in anonymous groups from which third parties can draw information. The system uses the smartphone GPS, while the acquisition of health data relies on sensors in smartwatch and smart band. TrackMe also offers free the possibility to activate the AutomatedSOS service, recommended for elderly people but open to anyone, thanks to which the monitoring of the health status of registered users will be taken to a subsequent level: in fact, if the vital parameters (heartbeat and blood pressure) exceed certain thresholds, an emergency call will be automatically activated to mobilize an ambulance, with the guarantee that this call will take place within 5 seconds from the time the thresholds are exceeded. Finally, TrackMe offers an additional service to take advantage of the data collected with Data4Help: Track4Run. This last service, on payment, if activated allows you to be tracked as an athlete participating in a race, therefore allows the organizers to create events that other users can decide whether to participate or simply follow the race from their smartphone.

\subsection{Scope}
\subsubsection{Description of the given problem}
\subsubsection{Goals}
\hspace{-\parindent}[G1] - Users and third parties can be recognized by providing a form with their data\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G2] - Allow third parties to access to the data of some specific individuals\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G3] - Allow third parties to access to anonymized data of groups of individuals\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G4] - Allow third parties to subscribe to new data and to receive them as soon as they are produced\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G5] - Allow the users, through the AutomatedSOS service, to come help by an ambulance when such parameters fall below certain thresholds\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G6] - Allow racing organizers, through the Track4Run service, to manage runs and define a path for runs\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G7] - Allow racing partecipants to enroll runs\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G8] - Allow racing spectators to see on a map the position of all runners during the run\newline

\hspace{-\parindent}[G9] - Allow users to monitor their own health status\newline

\subsection{Document Structure}
\hspace{-\parindent}Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the problem and describes the purpose of the application
TrackMe. The scope of the application is defined by stating the goals and description of the problem.\newline
\\
Chapter 2 presents the overall description of the project. The product perspective includes details on
the shared phenomena and the domain models. The class diagram describes the domain model used,
and the state diagram analyzes the process of arranging a meeting and reaching it in time. Here the
majority of functions of the system are more precisely specified, with respect to the already mentioned
goals of the system. In the user characteristics section the types of actors that can use the application
are described.\newline
\\
Chapter 3 contains the external interface requirements, including: user interfaces, hardware interfaces,
software interfaces and communication interfaces. Few scenarios describing specific situations are listed
here. Furthermore, the functional requirements are defined by using use case and sequence diagram.
The non-functional requirements are defined through performance requirements, design constraints
and software system attributes.\newline
\\
Chapter 4 includes the alloy model and the discussion of its purpose. Also, a world generated by it is
shown.\newline
\\
Chapter 5 shows the effort spent by each group member while working on this project.\newline
\\
Chapter 6 includes the reference documents.
